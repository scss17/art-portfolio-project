                Born in 1998 in Durango, Mexico. Maria Campos is a Mexican
                artist currently living in British Columbia, Canada, since 2022.
                Maria earned her Bachelor of Architecture from the Monterrey
                Institute of Technology and Higher Education in 2021. Before
                graduating, she gained international experience in La Coru√±a,
                Spain. Additionally, she had the opportunity to complete an
                internship at INTERCERAMIC. This company manufactures ceramic
                and porcelain tiles for floors and walls, where she was involved
                in the design and construction of store layouts.

                In 2022, Maria moved to Canada to expand her skill set by

                expected to graduate in 2025. Maria has participated in several
                art exhibitions, including "Out of the Grey," "Library
                Mezzanine," "Brainstorm," and "Narrative to Reality." This year,
                she will be featured in the Grad Show Exhibition, showcasing the
                work of visual arts graduates at Camosun.
